ABOUT ME

🧠 Maaz Ahmed
Aspiring Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast | Data Analyst

I am a data-focused technologist with strong interests in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Applied AI systems. My work centers around transforming raw data into structured insights and deployable intelligence — from exploratory analysis and feature engineering to building and optimizing machine learning models for real-world use cases.

I have hands-on experience in designing end-to-end ML workflows, including recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, clustering-based segmentation, and computer vision pipelines. I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between modeling and production by building scalable, deployable solutions using tools like Python, SQL, Docker, and cloud platforms.

Beyond modeling, I have worked on data warehousing, ETL pipelines, interactive analytics dashboards, and full-stack business applications — giving me a practical understanding of how data systems integrate into broader organizational workflows. I enjoy building systems that are not just technically sound, but business-relevant and performance-aware.
